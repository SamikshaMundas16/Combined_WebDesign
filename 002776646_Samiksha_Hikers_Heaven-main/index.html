              <h3>Trekking</h3>
              <main><p>Our trekking and hiking excursions take you to some of the most remote and beautiful regions on earth, with many of our treks starting where other treks end.
  
                You can choose from a variety of basic treks to tough treks meant to bring you closer to the culture and wilderness of a country, as well as some of the most off-the-beaten-track trekking experiences in the entire world.
                Your participation in one of our trekking programs means that you are supporting the local community in growing and developing both economically and environmentally, whether it is by using semi-permanent campsites to discourage logging in the Himalayas or through hiring local guides, porters, and cooks.

                <main>
                  <p>Our mountaineering curriculum is level-appropriate, featuring everything from basic skill-based training to challenging adventures under the direction of an expert. Plan a mountaineering trip with Globe Expeditions, and you'll have access to some of the most knowledgeable guides in the business and see the world from a perspective that not many people do. You can be sure that you'll return home with memories of an unforgettable journey that has taken you to new heights and self discovery, regardless of whether you're an experienced mountaineer who has had years of practice conquering peaks or a beginner looking to take your outdoor travels up a notch to explore the wild, less traveled regions and peaks of the world.
